          <p> One of the most dreaded things to happen to an individual or a man for that matter is to wake up one day and discover this his receding hairline has now become more obvious. Definitely, one would immediately look for a solution that will hopefully work. Will hair transplant be a good hair loss treatment for men? </p>
          <h4> The 411 on Receding Hairline </h4>
          <p> A receding hairline is an early warning sign of baldness or balding. There are two potential causes for it â€“ genetics and time. While it is common in men to experience male pattern baldness, genetic predisposition or even illnesses can also exacerbate the rate at which hair is lost. </p>
          <p> A receding hairline starts to develop in men as they age, but it can also come early for some guys. Usually, a receding hairline can start any time after the end of puberty. By the time most men reach their late 30s, they may already have a receding hairline. The shedding usually and insidiously starts above the temples. From there, the hairline moves back across the top of the head. This often leaves a ring of hair around the top of a bare scalp. </p>
          <p> As mentioned earlier, a receding hairline is hereditary. Men who have a family history of baldness are more likely to lose their hair. It is triggered by an imbalance in male hormones, with the age at which it affects someone often similar from one generation to the next. </p>
          <h4> The Solutions to Consider </h4>
          <p> Treatments for the receding hairline are available. This can include medications, low-level laser light therapy, and hair transplants. </p>
          <p> Among the treatments available today, hair transplant is known to deliver long-lasting results, but it should be considered as a last resort. It involves the transplanting of small sections of scalp and hair follicles from the back of the head to areas where hairs have ceased to grow. Hair may continue to grow normally in the areas that supplied the plugs. </p>
          <p> Today, hair transplant physicians are able to make use of different techniques to extract and transplant large numbers of hair follicles. They even developed a skillful way of suturing incisions and concealing scars to create more aesthetically pleasing results. </p>
          <h4> Choosing Between FUE or FUT Hair Transplant </h4>
          <p> There are two primary techniques for hair transplantation currently in use. They are the FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction)and FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation)methods. </p>
          <p> The FUT process, also known as Strip Harvesting, is the traditional technique which involves the removal of a small strip of scalp from the back of the head which contains the donor hair follicles. The hair grafts are harvested by a skilled hair technician before they are individually transplanted to the recipient areas. </p>
          <p> FUT typically allows more grafts to be transplanted in a single session compared to FUE. Due to its invasive nature, recovery takes longer, and it comes with a permanent scar on the donor area. </p>
